# LocalWebServer

LocalWebServer is an iOS SDK demo that showcases how to implement a local web server using CocoaHttpServer and HTTPS. The project provides a simple example of how to serve content locally from an iOS device, making it useful for local development, testing, and debugging.

## Features

- Provides a simple example of how to implement a local web server in iOS using CocoaHttpServer.
- Supports HTTPS for secure local connections.
- Demonstrates how to serve static files and dynamic content from an iOS device.
- Provides a set of default certificates to enable HTTPS support.
- Includes a demo app that showcases how to use the local web server to serve content.

## Safety

LocalWebServer takes safety seriously and has implemented several security measures to ensure the safety of the local web server. HTTPS support ensures secure communication between the server and clients. The default certificates provided with the project have been generated using the best practices and are designed to provide strong encryption for secure connections.

In addition, LocalWebServer follows the best practices of secure coding and has been designed to minimize the risk of common vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.

## Speed

LocalWebServer has been optimized for speed and provides a fast and efficient way to serve content locally from an iOS device. The project uses the highly efficient CocoaHttpServer library, which has been optimized for performance and provides a highly scalable and reliable web server implementation.

In addition, LocalWebServer uses caching and other performance optimizations to ensure that content is served as quickly as possible, even on low-end devices.

## Getting started
To get started with LocalWebServer, simply clone the project and open the demo app in Xcode. The demo app provides a simple example of how to use the local web server to serve content from an iOS device.
